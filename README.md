# MMO-EvoKnee
Knee based Multimodal Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm for Decision Making

We propose a knee based evolutionary algorithm, named MMO-EvoKnee, which incorporates MCDM strategy into solving MMOPs. The proposed algorithm can find a complete set of global knee solutions accurately instead of an entire Pareto front and Pareto sets. As a result, MMO-EvoKnee can consistently find all knee solutions of interest quickly, and it relieves the burden for decision makers.

In addition, DMOES can obtain a well-converged and well-diversified Pareto front with much less population size and far lower computational cost. The larger the number of individuals, the sharper the contour of the resulted approximate Pareto front will be.
